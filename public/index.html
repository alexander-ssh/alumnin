                <div class="storyDesc"><span class="focus">But what happens next?</span> Career, projects, new challenges. Communication with classmates moves to instant messengers and boring university forums, but there is something important missing. Personalities get lost
                    behind avatars and nicknames, conversations blur among the many chats. Groups grow either to huge sizes, where no one is ready to reveal their true selves,or narrow down to a few selected friends.  </div>

                                Even if you download the app, access to specific alumni groups and communities can only be authorized by the presidents of the respective clubs and trusted community members. You may have to show your diploma if no one remembered you in class, or come
                                to a face-to-face event.

                                We have no secrets in the group. Unlike all anonymous messengers, after an authorized login to the group, each participant sees information about other participants, like a resume, only cooler. Even if he doesn't know them personally. This will help you
                                find common topics faster and build more meaningful communication.
